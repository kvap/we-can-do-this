We Can Do This
==============

This is a simple puzzle game about a starship crew fixing their vessel in zero
gravity. You control multiple characters, who cannot change direction of
floating until they touch a wall or an object. Currently, only one character
mode implemented, but the game is supposed to have situations where it is only
possible to do something when characters help each other.

Dependencies
------------

- SFML
- OpenGL

Ship Editor
-----------

The ship editor is available if you press `E` on the intro screen. See
`sources/scenes/Editor.cpp` for the key mapping.
